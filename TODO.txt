TODO file

Idea: have the user put a plus sign at the start of any line of the
name of the file they wish to delete. Write a second script that goes
through the dup_report.txt file and deletes all files with a plus
sign in front. It should warn if asking to delete all the files or
not all of them.

have a command line option to have a minimum size file that gets
listed.

DONE sort the output by filesize. It is about saving disk space afterall.

Create the dup_file_del.pl program. This program reads in the output
file of dup_file_find and, after the user has modified it, deletes the
files the user has selected.
